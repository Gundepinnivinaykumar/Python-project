RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR

code explanation:

 The code starts by declaring a variable called total.
 This is the string that will be used to generate passwords.
 The next line declares a variable called length, which is an integer and will hold the number of characters in the password.
 The code then asks for input from the user on how many characters they want in their password.
 Once they enter this information, it uses int() to convert it into an integer value and assigns it to length.
 Next, random() generates a list of all possible values for total with length as its parameter (random(length)).
 Then join() joins these values together into one long string using "".join().
 Finally print() prints out this string so that we can see what our generated password would look like if we were to use it as-is without any modifications or alterations made by us.
 The code will generate a random password of the length you input.
